# Graphing-Calculator
A computer graphics project using graphics.h library
This project is a graphing calculator implemented as a menu driven application where we can draw graphs for different sets of curves and fuctions (be it logarithmic, trigonometric, Algebraic and other functions) and we also can draw multiple graphs in the same runtime to compare two graphs and it can be separated using different colours.
